To invite someone to view a repository on GitHub, you need to grant them access as a collaborator. Collaborators have read access to the repository, which allows them to view the code, issues, pull requests, and other repository content. Here's how you can invite someone to view a repository:
Method 1: Using GitHub Website:

    Navigate to the Repository:
    Open the repository on the GitHub website by going to the repository's URL or searching for it in the GitHub search bar.

    Click on "Settings":
    In the repository's menu bar, click on the "Settings" tab.

    Select "Manage Access":
    In the left sidebar, click on "Manage access" under the "Options" section.

    Invite Collaborator:
    In the "Collaborators" section, start typing the GitHub username, email address, or name of the person you want to invite. GitHub will suggest matching users from its database. Select the appropriate user from the suggestions.

    Send Invitation:
    Once you've selected the user, click on the "Add [username] to [repository name]" button. This sends an invitation to the user to become a collaborator on the repository.

Method 2: Using Command Line (Git):

    Navigate to the Local Repository:
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the local repository directory on your computer.

    Add Remote Collaborator:
    Use the following command to add a remote collaborator:

    bash

git remote add collaborator-name https://github.com/collaborator-username/repository-name.git

Replace collaborator-name with a name for the collaborator (e.g., origin, upstream, etc.), and replace collaborator-username/repository-name with the GitHub username and repository name of the collaborator you want to invite.

Push Changes to GitHub:
After adding the remote collaborator, push your changes to GitHub:

bash

    git push -u collaborator-name branch-name

    Replace collaborator-name with the name you assigned to the collaborator, and branch-name with the name of the branch you want to push.

Note:

    The invited collaborator will receive an email notification informing them of the invitation to collaborate on the repository. They can accept the invitation by following the link in the email or by navigating to the repository on the GitHub website.
    Collaborators with read access can view the repository but cannot make changes directly. If you want to grant them write access (allowing them to make changes), you can do so by changing their permissions in the repository settings.Creating comprehensive documentation for GitHub projects is crucial for ensuring their usability, maintainability, and accessibility. In this extensive guide, we'll delve deep into the world of GitHub documentation, covering everything from the importance of documentation to best practices, tools, and advanced techniques.

GitHub provides unlimited storage for public repositories, which means you can create as many public repositories as you want, and GitHub will host them for free without any storage limitations. However, GitHub does have limitations on the size of individual files and the total size of repositories for private repositories, depending on your account type.

Here's a breakdown of the storage limits for private repositories on GitHub:

1. **Free Plan (GitHub Free):**
   - For GitHub Free accounts, you are limited to:
     - **100 MB per repository:** Each repository is limited to 100 MB in size.
     - **1 GB total storage:** The total combined size of all your private repositories cannot exceed 1 GB.
   - These limits apply to both the repository's Git history (commits, branches, etc.) and any files or assets stored within the repository.

2. **Paid Plans (GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud):**
   - GitHub offers paid plans that provide increased storage and additional features.
   - With paid plans, you can have larger individual repositories and more storage space for your private repositories.
   - Paid plans also offer features such as advanced security, code review tools, and team collaboration features.

It's important to note that GitHub encourages the use of Git Large File Storage (LFS) for managing large files in repositories. Git LFS allows you to store large files externally and replace them in your repository with pointers, helping to keep your repository size manageable and avoiding the limitations on file sizes.

If you require more storage or additional features beyond what is offered in the free plan, you may consider upgrading to a paid plan to unlock additional benefits and resources. You can find more information about GitHub pricing and plans on the GitHub website.
